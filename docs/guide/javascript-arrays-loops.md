# Arrays and Loops in JavaScript

Hey there! Ready to learn about arrays and loops? These are super useful tools that will level up your coding skills. Let's break them down in a way that's easy to understand.

## What Are Arrays?

An array is like a list of things. Think of it as a special box that can hold multiple items at once.

```javascript
// Creating an array of favorite games
let games = ["Minecraft", "Fortnite", "Roblox", "Among Us"];

// Getting a specific item (remember, counting starts at 0!)
console.log("My favorite game is " + games[0]); // Shows: My favorite game is Minecraft
```

### Cool Things You Can Do With Arrays

```javascript
// How many items are in the array?
console.log(games.length); // Shows: 4

// Add a new game to the end of the list
games.push("FIFA");
console.log(games); // Now shows 5 games including FIFA

// Remove the last game from the list
let removedGame = games.pop();
console.log("I removed " + removedGame + " from my list");
```

## What Are Loops?

Loops let you repeat code multiple times without having to copy and paste. They're super handy!

### For Loops

A for loop is perfect when you know exactly how many times you want to repeat something.

```javascript
// Count from 1 to 5
for (let count = 1; count <= 5; count++) {
  console.log("Count: " + count);
}
// This will show: Count: 1, Count: 2, Count: 3, Count: 4, Count: 5
```

### Looping Through Arrays

This is where loops get really useful - you can go through each item in an array!

```javascript
// Print all games in our list
for (let i = 0; i < games.length; i++) {
  console.log((i+1) + ". " + games[i]);
}
// This creates a numbered list of all games
```

### The Easier Way: For...Of Loops

```javascript
// A simpler way to loop through arrays
for (let game of games) {
  console.log("I like playing " + game);
}
```

## Let's Make Something Fun!

Let's create a simple program that keeps track of your daily moods:

```javascript
// Create an array to store your mood for each day
let weeklyMoods = [];

// Function to add today's mood
function addMood(mood) {
  weeklyMoods.push(mood);
  console.log("Mood added!");
}

// Function to see all moods
function showAllMoods() {
  console.log("Your moods this week:");
  
  if (weeklyMoods.length === 0) {
    console.log("No moods recorded yet!");
    return;
  }
  
  for (let i = 0; i < weeklyMoods.length; i++) {
    let day = i + 1;
    console.log("Day " + day + ": " + weeklyMoods[i]);
  }
}

// Let's use our program
addMood("Happy");
addMood("Tired");
addMood("Excited");
showAllMoods();
```

## Challenge: Create Your Own Array

Try creating an array of your favorite foods, then use a loop to print them out. Can you figure out how to print your top 3 favorites?
